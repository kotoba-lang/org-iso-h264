  "Round-trip tests for `h264.cavlc`'s Wave 3 (ADR-2607122000 Migration step
   8) CAVLC ENCODE side (`encode-residual-block!`). The correctness bar
   here is stronger than \"produces well-formed bits\": every case encodes
   a `coeffs` (scan-order) array, then decodes the resulting bits with THIS
   REPO'S OWN already-tested (bit-exact-vs-real-ffmpeg) `residual-block!`,
   and asserts the decoded `:coeffs`/`:total-coeff` reproduce the input
   exactly. This is the same empirical-verification discipline the decode
   side's README documents using throughout."
