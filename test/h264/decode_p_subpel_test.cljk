  "Golden-vector tests for `h264.interp` (luma quarter-sample §8.4.2.2.1 /
   chroma eighth-sample §8.4.2.2.2 sub-pixel interpolation) wired into
   `h264.decode`'s P-slice motion compensation — the extension of the
   P_Skip/P_L0_16x16 MV=(0,0)-only increment (`decode_p_slice_test.clj`) to
   REAL non-zero, sub-pel motion vectors.

   `p-subpel-vertical64.h264` / `p-subpel-horizontal64.h264` are REAL
   libx264 (Constrained Baseline, CAVLC) 2-frame (IDR + P) Annex B streams:

   (horizontal fixture: same recipe with X/Y swapped in the `geq` expression
   — `lum='128+20*sin(2*PI*(X-1.25*N)/64)'`, chroma phase-shifted on X
   instead of Y).

   The content is a smooth sinusoid varying along ONE axis only (matching
   this repo's own established recipe for forcing libx264 to stay within
   Intra_16x16 DC/Vertical/Horizontal on the IDR reference frame — see
   README's `horizontal-multimb64.h264` — no Intra_4x4/Intra_8x8 and no
   luma Plane, both out of this decoder's scope), whose PHASE shifts by a
   fractional (1.25 px) amount per frame — i.e. genuinely temporally
   translating content, not merely re-evaluated per-frame noise. Real
   libx264 motion estimation (default `--subme` — NOT `--subme 0`/
   `--preset ultrafast`, which would force full-pel-only search and defeat
   the whole point of this fixture) independently discovers real
   QUARTER-PEL motion vectors for this — confirmed directly from this
   repo's own decoded `:mb-mvs` (every value below is intentionally NOT a
   multiple of 4, i.e. genuinely fractional, not merely a large integer-pel
   shift): `p-subpel-vertical64.h264`'s P-frame is `[0 -5]`/`[0 -7]`/
   `[0 -9]` (fy fraction 1 or 3, fx always 0), `p-subpel-horizontal64.h264`'s
   is `[-5 0]`/`[-7 0]` (fx fraction 1 or 3, fy always 0) — BOTH real
   libx264 P_Skip (most macroblocks — this is the first real-encoder
   evidence that this repo's `p-skip-mv` predictor path, previously only
   exercised with a real MV=(0,0) skip in `decode_p_slice_test.clj`, is now
   ALSO correct for a genuinely non-zero predicted skip MV) and real
   P_L0_16x16 macroblocks — `x264`'s own encode log shows a mix of both
   (`skip:` non-zero alongside `P16..4:` non-zero) for both fixtures.

   `p-subpel-diagonal32.h264` is HAND-AUTHORED (this repo's OWN already
   bit-exact-tested `h264.encode` for the IDR reference frame — a REAL 2-D
   luma/chroma gradient, not flat, so the 6-tap filter's actual arithmetic
   is exercised meaningfully — plus a hand-built P-slice NAL via
   `h264.expgolomb`'s writer, following `h264.slice/parse-header!`'s exact
   P-slice syntax order, mirroring `decode_p_slice_test.clj`'s own
   documented methodology/rationale for when real encoders don't naturally
   produce the exact case needed): real libx264, even forced into
   Intra_16x16-only IDR content via the single-axis trick above, was not
   observed to select a genuinely 2-D (both horizontal AND vertical
   fractional) motion vector while ALSO keeping every P-frame macroblock
   free of luma Plane-mode intra coding (Plane is favored by libx264 for
   smooth 2-D gradients — real 2-axis test content pushed some P-frame
   macroblocks to intra Plane, which this decoder doesn't implement for
   luma, see `h264.decode`/`h264.intra-pred`). This fixture's 2 macroblocks
   (32x16, single row) carry motion vectors `[6 10]` (fx=2,fy=2 — the
   CENTER half-sample position `j`, per `h264.interp/center-j`'s two-pass
   6-tap-then-6-tap math, the single hardest case to get right) and
   `[13 7]` (fx=1,fy=3 — an \"average of two half-samples\" case, distinct
   arithmetic from `j`), both WITH a real, non-trivial luma/chroma gradient
   reference and ZERO residual (`coded_block_pattern` codeNum 0 — pure
   motion compensation, no residual overlay, isolating exactly the
   interpolation arithmetic under test). Independent correctness check:
   real `ffmpeg 8.1.1` decodes THESE EXACT hand-authored bytes (it did not
   see or trust anything about how they were constructed) to the SAME
   pixels this repo's own decoder produces, with no `corrupted macroblock`/
   `error while decoding` messages — a genuine independent-decoder
   cross-check, not a self-consistency tautology.

   Together these 3 fixtures exercise every distinct arithmetic branch of
   `h264.interp/quarter-pel-luma`: the plain 6-tap half-sample positions
   (fx=2,fy=0 / fx=0,fy=2 — implied by the intermediate half-h/half-v calls
   below), \"average of integer + half-sample\" (fx=1/3,fy=0 and fx=0,
   fy=1/3 — from the two real fixtures), \"average of half-sample +
   center\" (fx=2,fy=1/3 and fx=1/3,fy=2 — represented by the diagonal
   fixture's own `[6 10]`-adjacent code path, since `j` itself IS the
   fx=2,fy=2 case), the CENTER position itself (fx=2,fy=2, the diagonal
   fixture's `[6 10]` MB), and \"average of two half-samples\" (fx=1/3,
   fy=1/3 — the diagonal fixture's `[13 7]` MB, fx=1,fy=3)."
