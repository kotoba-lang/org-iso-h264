  "Guards `resources/h264/kotoba-vectors/kernel-vectors.edn`, the file the
  JVM-free kernel verifier compares against.

  The verifier itself cannot run these checks: it deliberately has no JVM,
  so it cannot ask the `.cljc` decoder anything. What it can do is compare
  against a file — and a file is only worth comparing against if something
  proves it still says what the decoder says, and that its inverse-transform
  inputs really came out of a real bitstream rather than out of someone's
  head. That is this namespace's whole job. It is the reason the vectors are
  evidence and not decoration.

  Regenerate with `scripts/gen_kernel_vectors.clj` if the decoder's
  arithmetic ever legitimately changes."
