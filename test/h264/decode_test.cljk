  "Golden-vector tests for `h264.decode` (ADR-2607122000 Phase 1 / \"R0.5\").

   Both fixtures are REAL libx264 (Constrained Baseline profile, CAVLC)
   Annex B elementary streams, generated as follows (also see README):

   `flat16-dc-only.h264` — a single 16x16 flat-gray macroblock:
     ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=0x808080:s=16x16 -frames:v 1 -update 1 test16.png
     ffmpeg -i test16.png -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline \\
       -x264opts keyint=1:qp=26 -frames:v 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p flat16-dc-only.h264
   This encodes as a single Intra_16x16 macroblock, DC prediction mode,
   CodedBlockPatternLuma=0 (no AC residual — only the luma DC/Hadamard
   coefficient is coded), exercising: SPS/PPS/slice-header parsing,
   mb_type→Intra_16x16 mapping, CAVLC decode of the luma DC block (nC=0,
   no neighbor MBs), the DC Hadamard transform + dequant, and DC-mode
   16x16 prediction with unavailable neighbors (defaults to 128).

   `gradient16-ac.h264` — a single 16x16 macroblock with a horizontal
   luma gradient (100..140), forced to Intra_16x16 (`--partitions none`)
   at a QP where libx264 codes real AC residual for all four luma 8x8
   groups (CodedBlockPatternLuma=15):
     ffmpeg -i softgrad16.png -pix_fmt yuv420p soft16.y4m
     x264 --input-res 16x16 --fps 25 -o gradient16-ac.h264 --qp 27 \\
       --keyint 1 --partitions none --profile baseline soft16.y4m
   This additionally exercises: real CAVLC coeff_token/level/total_zeros/
   run_before decode with nonzero levels and nonzero total_zeros/run_before,
   within-macroblock CAVLC neighbor (nC) derivation across the 16 luma 4x4
   sub-blocks, per-position AC dequantization, and the full 4x4 inverse
   transform (`h264.transform/inverse-4x4`) combined with the DC term.

   Both fixtures' reference output (`*.ref.yuv`) was produced by decoding
   the SAME `.h264` file with a real ffmpeg:
     ffmpeg -i <fixture>.h264 -pix_fmt yuv420p <fixture>.ref.yuv
   — i.e. the comparison is against ffmpeg's OWN reconstructed pixels (not
   the pre-encode source image, since lossy encoding changes pixel values).
   Bit-exact — no tolerance/epsilon is used anywhere in these assertions —
   for luma AND chroma (Cb/Cr, bytes 256..320 / 320..384 of the yuv420p
   file for these 16x16 fixtures; both single-MB streams happen to carry
   chroma DC-only residual, `CodedBlockPatternChroma` 0 or 1 — real chroma
   AC residual (`CodedBlockPatternChroma` == 2) and multi-macroblock
   pictures are validated separately below,
   `chroma-multimb32-golden-vector`).

   `chroma-multimb32.h264` (32x32, 2x2 macroblocks) — see that fixture's
   own docstring in `chroma-multimb32-golden-vector` below for how it was
   generated and what it exercises (real chroma AC + multi-macroblock
   cross-MB neighbor derivation + multiple distinct luma/chroma prediction
   modes actually selected by a real encoder).

   `horizontal-multimb64.h264` (64x64, 4x4=16 macroblocks) — see
   `horizontal-multimb64-golden-vector` below: real libx264-selected
   Intra_16x16 LUMA Horizontal prediction (mode 1) across 12 of the 16
   macroblocks, both DC-only and full-AC luma coded-block-pattern paths.
   Fixes a real desync/wrong-pixel bug this repo shipped with (see
   `h264.decode/blk->col-row` and `h264.transform/luma-dc-hadamard`
   docstrings)."

     Luma is flat (uniform mid-gray) — deliberately, so libx264 never has
     an RD-cost reason to spend bits on luma residual/small-block intra,
     keeping all 4 macroblocks Intra_16x16 (real encoder log:
     `mb I  I16..4: 100.0%  0.0%  0.0%`) — while Cb/Cr carry a genuine 2-D
     oscillating pattern (`sin`/`cos` of position) so CHROMA gets real,

     0.0% 100.0% 100.0%` — zero luma residual, full chroma DC AND AC).

     Luma varies smoothly by ROW only (constant along each row, `sin` of Y) —
     deliberately, so libx264 has a genuine RD reason to pick Intra_16x16
     LUMA HORIZONTAL prediction (mode 1, copy the left neighbor's column)
     for most macroblocks once a left neighbor is available; chroma is flat
     (already validated bit-exact by `chroma-multimb32-golden-vector`, not
     the point of this fixture). `--no-deblock` sets
     `disable_deblocking_filter_idc=1` in the slice header (a properly
     signaled, spec-mandatory flag — decoders MUST skip deblocking when
     it's set) so this fixture's genuine cross-block-boundary gradient
     doesn't require the (out-of-scope, undocumented-as-implemented)
     deblocking loop filter to match ffmpeg's own decode bit-exact.

     This is the first bit-exact-validated real-encoder example of luma
     Horizontal (mode 1) in a multi-macroblock picture (`:mb-pred-modes` is
     `[2 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1]` — DC only for MB0 (no neighbors),
     Vertical for the leftmost MB of each subsequent row (top neighbor
     only), Horizontal for every other MB — 12 of 16), exercising BOTH real
     cross-macroblock CAVLC neighbor (nC) derivation for the Intra16x16
     LUMA DC block specifically (previously only exercised for chroma —
     see `h264.decode/decode-macroblock!`'s `dc-nc` computation) and the
     luma DC Hadamard transform's own block-index correspondence for
     content that varies along ONE screen axis only, distinguishing it from
     `gradient16-ac.h264` (single-MB, no cross-MB neighbor) and
     `chroma-multimb32.h264` (flat luma). Previously an open, tracked
     limitation (see README \"Pixel decode\" — real x264 streams selecting
     luma Horizontal across multiple macroblocks reproducibly desynced the
     CAVLC bit reader a few macroblocks in); root-caused to two independent
     bugs that had to be fixed together: (1) the Intra16x16 luma DC block's
     cross-MB nC derivation was reading the wrong neighbor state
     (`:dc-nnz`, the neighbor's own DC total-coeff, instead of `:ac-nnz` at
     luma 4x4 block position [3,0]/[0,3] — see `h264.decode/decode-macroblock!`),
     and (2) `h264.decode/blk->col-row` used an incorrect column-major
     block-index-to-position mapping AND `h264.transform/luma-dc-hadamard`
     was missing an input transpose analogous to `inverse-4x4`'s own
     (documented) one — both independently re-derived and cross-checked
     against FFmpeg's `libavcodec/h264dec.c`/`h264_mb.c` source (see those

     Every earlier fixture in this file is FLAT or direction-degenerate for a
     structural reason: libx264 cannot be told to avoid Intra_4x4
     (`--partitions none` still leaves `analyse=0x1:0`, and that `0x1` is
     `X264_ANALYSE_I4x4`), so only content with no texture at all encodes
     without I_NxN macroblocks. Every fixture this repo had was flat for
     exactly that reason, which is why the decoder could pass its whole suite
     while rejecting anything a real encoder emits from real content. This
     fixture is deliberately the opposite: a Mandelbrot render, i.e. texture
     at every scale, at a QP where x264 chooses I_NxN for 15 of the 16
     macroblocks and uses ALL NINE §8.3.1.2 prediction modes (its own log:
     `i4 v,h,dc,ddl,ddr,vr,hd,vl,hu: 3% 15% 20% 15% 12% 7% 13% 5% 9%`).

     `--no-deblock` for the same reason as `horizontal-multimb64.h264`: real
     texture produces real block-boundary discontinuities, and this repo has
     no deblocking filter, so the flag has to be set for ffmpeg's own
     reconstruction to be the right thing to compare against.

     Reference pixels are ffmpeg's OWN decode of this same file
     (`ffmpeg -i i4x4-mandel64.h264 -pix_fmt yuv420p i4x4-mandel64.ref.yuv`),
