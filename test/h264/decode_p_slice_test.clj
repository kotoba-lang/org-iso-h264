  "Golden-vector tests for `h264.decode`'s P-slice (inter prediction) support
   — ADR-2607122000 Migration step 7's first increment: P_Skip + P_L0_16x16,
   MV=(0,0) motion compensation only, single reference frame (the
   immediately-preceding decoded picture). See `h264.decode`'s namespace
   docstring and `decode-gop` for the exact scope.

   `p-skip-flat16.h264` is a REAL libx264 (Constrained Baseline, CAVLC)
   2-frame (IDR + P) Annex B stream:
     ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=0x808080:s=16x16:r=25 -frames:v 2 \\
       -pix_fmt yuv420p flat16-2f.y4m
     x264 --input-res 16x16 --fps 25 -o p-skip-flat16.h264 --qp 26 \\
       --keyint 250 --min-keyint 2 --ref 1 --profile baseline flat16-2f.y4m
   Two IDENTICAL flat-gray frames — a real encoder has zero RD reason to
   spend ANY bits on the second frame beyond declaring it P_Skip (confirmed
   via the encoder's own log: `mb P ... skip:100.0%`, size 8 bytes). This
   is the single most basic real-world P-slice case: `mb_skip_run` covering
   the whole picture, zero macroblock_layer() calls at all.

   `p-16x16-mb0-realac.h264` and `p-skip-then-16x16-multimb.h264` are NOT
   x264 output — real encoders (verified empirically across dozens of
   qp/content/motion-estimation-range combinations while developing this
   fixture) essentially NEVER choose P_L0_16x16 with a genuinely zero final
   motion vector AND nonzero residual for any content that also keeps the
   REFERENCE frame's own intra coding within this repo's Intra_16x16-only
   scope: flat/near-flat content that avoids forcing Intra_4x4 in the IDR
   frame is exactly the content where ANY spatial correlation gives real
   motion search a incentive to find a nonzero (often just-better-by-a-
   hair) integer-pel shift instead of MV=(0,0) — observed directly (mv
   [0 4], [0 16], [0 32] on different gradient/texture fixtures — all
   real, all out of this milestone's motion-compensation scope, see
   `h264.decode/mc-predict`). Rather than ship an untestable P_L0_16x16
   path, these 2 fixtures are HAND-AUTHORED using this repo's OWN
   already-bit-exact-tested encode-side primitives (`h264.encode`'s
   `encode-idr-luma-frame` for the reference IDR frame; `h264.expgolomb`'s
   writer + `h264.cavlc/encode-residual-block!` for a hand-built P-slice
   NAL, following `h264.slice/parse-header!`'s exact P-slice syntax order)
   — NOT a claim that this exact bitstream is something a real encoder
   would produce, but a claim that it is a SPEC-VALID P_L0_16x16 macroblock
   (P_Skip's mb_skip_run bookkeeping, mvd/coded_block_pattern/mb_qp_delta/
   residual syntax all follow §7.3.5.1 exactly). The independent
   correctness check is the SAME bit-exact-vs-real-ffmpeg discipline this
   repo's whole decode side uses: real `ffmpeg 8.1.1` decodes THESE EXACT
   bytes to the SAME pixels this repo's own `h264.decode` produces — ffmpeg
   did not see or trust anything about how the bytes were constructed, only
   the bytes themselves, so this is a genuine independent-decoder
   cross-check, not a self-consistency tautology.

   `p-16x16-mb0-realac.h264` — single 16x16 MB (matching `p-skip-flat16`'s
   dimensions): IDR reference frame flat luma/chroma=128 (qp 26); P-slice
   is ONE P_L0_16x16 macroblock, mvd=(0,0) (so final mv=(0,0) — the only
   neighbor-derived predictor component available here, since there ARE no
   neighbors, is trivially (0,0) too), `coded_block_pattern` codeNum 2 →
   CodedBlockPatternLuma=1/CodedBlockPatternChroma=0 (`golomb-to-inter-cbp`
   Table 9-4 Inter mapping), real nonzero CAVLC residual (one coefficient,
   level 2) in ONLY the top-left 8x8 luma quadrant (blocks 0..3 — 3 of
   those 4 blocks still real-decoded as all-zero, exercising
   `decode-regular-block!`'s maxNumCoeff=16 full-block path, NOT the
   Intra16x16 DC/AC split), no chroma residual at all
   (CodedBlockPatternChroma=0).

   `p-skip-then-16x16-multimb.h264` — 32x16 (2 macroblocks, addr 0/1),
   otherwise IDENTICAL recipe: MB0 is `mb_skip_run`=1 (P_Skip, motion-
   compensated copy of the flat IDR reference, zero residual), MB1 is
   P_L0_16x16 with the SAME real-residual construction as
   `p-16x16-mb0-realac.h264`'s single MB — exercising the slice_data()
   loop's skip-run → macroblock_layer() TRANSITION (not just a
   single-macroblock-covers-the-whole-picture degenerate case) and
   cross-macroblock CAVLC neighbor (`nC`) derivation where the LEFT
   neighbor is itself a P_Skip macroblock (not another coded inter/intra
   MB) — `decode-p-skip-macroblock!`'s all-zero `:ac-nnz` contribution."
