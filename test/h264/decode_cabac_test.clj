  "Golden-vector tests for CABAC (main/high-profile entropy coding) decode
   (`h264.cabac`, wired into `h264.decode` — ADR-2607122000 CABAC increment).

   **Scope validated here: I-slice / Intra_16x16** (see `h264.cabac`'s
   namespace docstring for the full scope statement — CABAC + P-slice/
   inter, CABAC + I_NxN/I_PCM, and CABAC encode are all out of scope).
   Three fixtures are REAL libx264 (Main profile, CABAC — verified
   via `entropy_coding_mode_flag=1` in the actual PPS bits, not just the
   SPS `profile_idc`) Annex B elementary streams, generated exactly like
   this repo's own CAVLC counterparts (`flat16-dc-only.h264`/
   `gradient16-ac.h264` in `decode_test.clj`) but with `-profile:v main`
   (ffmpeg) / `--profile main` (x264) instead of baseline:

   `flat16-dc-only-cabac.h264`:
     ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=0x808080:s=16x16 -frames:v 1 -update 1 test16.png
     ffmpeg -i test16.png -c:v libx264 -profile:v main \\
       -x264opts keyint=1:qp=26 -frames:v 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p flat16-dc-only-cabac.h264
   A single flat 16x16 macroblock, DC prediction, `CodedBlockPatternLuma=0`
   (no AC residual — only the luma DC/Hadamard coefficient, itself zero for
   flat content, is coded). Exercises: the CABAC arithmetic decoding engine
   init/byte-alignment (`h264.cabac/byte-align!`/`init-engine!`), context
   model init from SliceQPY, `mb_type` (I-slice) binarization/context
   (unavailable-neighbor case), `intra_chroma_pred_mode`, `mb_qp_delta`, and
   the `coded_block_flag`=0 (empty-block) fast path for the DC block AND all
   16 AC blocks (since `CodedBlockPatternLuma=0` means the AC blocks aren't
   read at all, matching the CAVLC path's own `cbp-luma` gating) plus both
   chroma DC blocks.

   `gradient16-ac-cabac.h264`:
     ffmpeg -f lavfi -i \"color=size=16x16:c=black\" \\
       -vf \"geq=lum='100+3*X':cb=128:cr=128\" -frames:v 1 -update 1 softgrad16b.png
     ffmpeg -i softgrad16b.png -pix_fmt yuv420p soft16b.y4m
     x264 --input-res 16x16 --fps 25 -o gradient16-ac-cabac.h264 --qp 33 \\
       --keyint 1 --partitions none --no-deblock --profile main soft16b.y4m
   A single 16x16 macroblock with a real horizontal luma gradient, forced to
   Intra_16x16 (`--partitions none`) at a QP where libx264 codes real AC
   residual (`CodedBlockPatternLuma!=0`, real ffmpeg log:
   `coded y,uvDC,uvAC intra: 100.0% 0.0% 0.0%`). Exercises: real
   `coded_block_flag`=1 decode, `significant_coeff_flag`/
   `last_significant_coeff_flag` map decode, and `coeff_abs_level_minus1`
   (+bypass sign bit) for a genuinely nonzero AC coefficient — i.e. the full
   CABAC residual decode path (`h264.cabac/residual-block!`), not just the
   empty-block fast path the flat fixture exercises.

   `--no-deblock` (`disable_deblocking_filter_idc=1`, spec-mandated,
   properly signaled in the slice header) is REQUIRED for this fixture: an
   earlier attempt without it decoded successfully but was off by ±1 at
   every internal 4x4 transform-block boundary — a real libx264 in-loop
   deblocking-filter effect this repo's decoder (CABAC OR CAVLC alike) does
   not implement, same limitation the existing CAVLC
   `horizontal-multimb64.h264` fixture documents (see `decode_test.clj`).
   This was root-caused during this increment's own development by manually
   verifying the pre-deblock reconstruction (from this decoder's own decoded
   coefficients, fed back through the already-tested `h264.transform`
   pipeline) matched ffmpeg's OWN output only once `--no-deblock` was added
   — i.e. confirmed to be a deblocking difference, not a CABAC decode bug.

   **Multi-macroblock CABAC pictures, and 4x4 residual blocks with MORE
   THAN ONE significant coefficient, are now ALSO confirmed bit-exact**
   (`multimb64-cabac-golden-vector` below) — this was a real, now
   root-caused and fixed bug (see `h264.cabac/decode-exp-golomb-bypass!`'s
   own docstring for the full root-cause trail): the EG0 bypass-suffix
   accumulator was silently discarding the suffix value whenever a
   coefficient's magnitude was large enough to saturate
   `decode-ueg-level!`'s truncated-unary bank (cMax=13, i.e.
   `coeff_abs_level_minus1 >= 14`) — invisible on the two single-MB
   fixtures above (neither has a coefficient anywhere near that large) but
   reliably wrong on real complex multi-macroblock content. Root-caused via
   an independent from-scratch Python re-implementation of the arithmetic
   engine + context-init tables (cross-checked programmatically against
   Cisco OpenH264's own `common_tables.cpp`/`parse_mb_syn_cabac.cpp` —
   zero diffs across all 460 context-init entries and every block-category
   constant), which reproduced the IDENTICAL wrong bin sequence and
   coefficient values on the new multi-macroblock fixture — confirming the
   entropy decode's CONTROL FLOW (which bins, in what order, against which
   contexts) was already correct, narrowing the bug to the one arithmetic
   combination step that was actually wrong."

     Two-frequency luma texture (a slow sine along Y combined with a much
     faster sine along X) deliberately chosen so libx264 (i16 v,h,dc,p:
     19%/75%/6%/0% — no Plane, this decoder's own out-of-scope Intra_16x16
     mode) picks real DC/Horizontal/Vertical prediction with GENUINE,
     substantial residual energy per macroblock — unlike
     `gradient16-ac-cabac.h264` (single MB, exactly ONE significant AC
     coefficient), several 4x4 blocks here have 3+ significant coefficients
     (`coded_block_flag`=1 blocks whose `coeff_abs_level_minus1` decode
     visits the `c1`/`c2` adaptive-context state machine repeatedly per
     block AND, critically, reaches large enough per-coefficient magnitude
     to exercise the EG0 bypass-suffix continuation in
     `h264.cabac/decode-ueg-level!`/`decode-exp-golomb-bypass!` — exactly
     the previously-NOT-root-caused multi-macroblock limitation this
     namespace's own docstring and README documented).

     THIS WAS THE BUG (see `h264.cabac/decode-exp-golomb-bypass!`'s own
     docstring for the full root-cause trail): the EG0 bypass suffix
     accumulator was reusing the prefix unary run's OWN accumulator (via
     `bit-or`) instead of a separate one added at the end — a
     `count`-length unary prefix always sums to exactly `2^count - 1` (ALL
     `count` low bits already 1), so OR-ing `count` MORE suffix bits into
     those SAME bit positions is a silent no-op REGARDLESS of the actual
     suffix value, truncating every large `coeff_abs_level_minus1` to the
     truncated-unary prefix's own value. Invisible on both single-MB
     fixtures above (neither has a coefficient large enough to reach the
     EG0 path at all); reliably wrong here (root-caused via an independent
     from-scratch Python re-implementation of the arithmetic engine +
     context-init tables, cross-checked bit-for-bit against Cisco
     OpenH264's own `common_tables.cpp`/`parse_mb_syn_cabac.cpp`, which
     reproduced the identical wrong bin sequence — confirming the entropy
     decode CONTROL FLOW was already correct and narrowing the bug to this
     one arithmetic step)."
