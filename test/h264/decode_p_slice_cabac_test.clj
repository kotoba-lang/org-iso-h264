(ns h264.decode-p-slice-cabac-test
  "Golden-vector tests for CABAC + P-slice/inter prediction decode —
   ADR-2607122000's CABAC+P-slice increment, combining `h264.cabac`'s
   I-slice/Intra_16x16 CABAC entropy decode (previously validated in
   `decode_cabac_test.clj`) with the CAVLC-only P-slice inter-prediction
   pipeline (`decode_p_slice_test.clj`) for the FIRST time. Scope: P_Skip
   and P_L0_16x16 only (mirrors the CAVLC P-slice scope) — sub-partitioned
   inter (`mb_type` 1..4) and intra-coded macroblocks WITHIN a CABAC
   P-slice both throw explicitly (see `h264.decode/decode-p-slice-mbs-cabac!`'s
   own docstring for exactly why the latter is a narrower scope than the
   CAVLC P-slice path).

   `p-skip-flat16-cabac.h264` — REAL libx264 (Main profile, CABAC) 2-frame
   (IDR + P) stream:
     ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=0x808080:s=16x16:r=25 -frames:v 2 \\
       -pix_fmt yuv420p flat16-2f-cabac.y4m
     x264 --input-res 16x16 --fps 25 -o p-skip-flat16-cabac.h264 --qp 26 \\
       --keyint 250 --min-keyint 2 --ref 1 --profile main --weightp 0 \\
       flat16-2f-cabac.y4m
   Two IDENTICAL flat-gray frames (the CABAC counterpart of
   `decode_p_slice_test.clj`'s `p-skip-flat16.h264`) — libx264 has zero RD
   reason to spend any bits on the P-frame beyond declaring it P_Skip
   (`mb P ... skip:100.0%` in the real encoder's own log). Exercises: CABAC
   `mb_skip_flag` (§9.3.3.1.1.3/Table 9-11 ctxIdxOffset 11) for EVERY
   macroblock address (unlike CAVLC's run-length `mb_skip_run`), the
   P-slice-only `cabac_init_idc` slice-header field
   (`h264.slice/parse-header!`), and `h264.cabac/init-contexts`'s
   `cabac_init_idc`-selected P-slice context-init column (as opposed to
   I-slice's single fixed column) — all for the FIRST time.

   `p-l0-16x16-multimb64-cabac.h264` — ALSO REAL libx264 (Main profile,
   CABAC) 2-frame stream:
     ffmpeg -f lavfi -i \"nullsrc=size=64x64,geq=lum='128+40*sin(2*PI*Y/16)+25*sin(2*PI*(X-1.25*N)/6)':cb=128:cr=128\" \\
       -frames:v 2 -pix_fmt yuv420p multimb2f.y4m
     x264 --input-res 64x64 --fps 25 -o p-l0-16x16-multimb64-cabac.h264 \\
       --qp 20 --keyint 250 --min-keyint 2 --ref 1 --preset ultrafast \\
       --no-deblock --profile main --partitions none --cabac --weightp 0 \\
       multimb2f.y4m
   64x64 (4x4=16 macroblocks), a two-frequency luma texture (slow sine
   along Y, much faster period-6 sine along X) translating by 1.25px/frame
   along X — chosen so the IDR reference frame stays 100% Intra_16x16
   (real encoder log: `mb I  I16..4: 100.0%  0.0%  0.0%`, no Intra_4x4/
   Intra_8x8, both out of this decoder's scope) while the P-frame is 100%
   P_L0_16x16 (`mb P ... P16..4: 100.0% ... skip: 0.0%`) with REAL nonzero
   luma AC residual in EVERY macroblock (`coded y ... inter: 100.0%` — the
   1.25px real shift isn't representable by this decoder's/any spec-
   compliant integer-motion-vector P_L0_16x16 alone, so the encoder's
   real motion search picks an integer-ish quarter-pel `mvd` and covers the
   remainder with residual). This is the strongest CABAC+P-slice
   interoperability evidence here: the FULL P_L0_16x16 CABAC pipeline
   (`mb_skip_flag`=0, P-slice `mb_type` binarization picking mb_type 0,
   `mvd_l0` UEG3 binarization for BOTH components, `coded_block_pattern`'s
   CABAC-specific per-8x8-quadrant-bit binarization — a COMPLETELY
   DIFFERENT binarization from CAVLC's me(v) table lookup, see
   `h264.cabac/read-coded-block-pattern-inter-cabac!` — `mb_qp_delta`, and
   16 FULL 4x4 \"regular\" residual blocks via the NEW `:luma-regular` CABAC
   block category, `h264.cabac/decode-regular-block-cabac!`) across 16
   real macroblocks with real cross-macroblock `coded_block_flag`/`mvd`/
   `coded_block_pattern` neighbor-context derivation.

   **A real, now-fixed bug was found and root-caused while validating this
   fixture** (see `h264.decode/decode-chroma-ac-blocks-cabac!`'s own
   docstring for the full root-cause trail): `coded_block_flag`'s
   unavailable-neighbor default (§9.3.3.1.1.9) is `!!IS_INTRA(CURRENT
   macroblock)` — i.e. it depends on whether the CURRENT (not the
   neighbor's) macroblock is intra or inter — but the CABAC+P-slice
   increment's first draft of `decode-inter-16x16-macroblock-cabac!`'s
   luma/chroma-DC unavailable-neighbor defaults, and
   `decode-chroma-ac-blocks-cabac!`'s (a fn shared with the intra CABAC
   path), all hardcoded `true` — copied verbatim from the pre-existing
   I-slice-only CABAC code, where `true` IS correct (every macroblock
   there is intra by construction) but is WRONG for an inter macroblock
   (should be `false`). This was invisible on `p-skip-flat16-cabac.h264`
   (P_Skip never reads `coded_block_flag`/residual at all) but caused
   real, substantial, wrong-looking-but-plausible-shaped pixel corruption
   on `p-l0-16x16-multimb64-cabac.h264` starting from the SECOND
   macroblock (the first macroblock has no left/top neighbors at all,
   coincidentally hiding the bug for it alone) — cross-checked via an
   independent from-scratch Python re-implementation of the CABAC engine +
   P-slice syntax elements (same methodology as the original I-slice CABAC
   EG0-bypass bug this repo already root-caused), which reproduced the
   IDENTICAL wrong values, confirming the bug was in the shared algorithm
   understanding (a genuine spec-mapping mistake) rather than a Clojure-
   specific typo, before being traced to this exact unavailable-neighbor-
   default mismatch by comparing motion-compensation-only reconstruction
   (verified correct) against the full (residual-included) reconstruction
   (verified WRONG) for the first two real macroblocks."
