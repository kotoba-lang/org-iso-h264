  "Golden-vector tests for `h264.decode`'s P-slice sub-partitioned inter
   prediction support — ADR-2607122000 Migration step 7's sub-partition
   increment: P_16x8/P_8x16 (mb_type 1/2, two 16x8 or 8x16 partitions, each
   with its own motion vector) and P_8x8 (mb_type 3, four 8x8 partitions,
   but ONLY sub_mb_type P_L0_8x8 — no further split within an 8x8 partition;
   `mb_type` 4/P_8x8ref0 and sub_mb_type 1/2/3 remain out of scope, both
   throwing explicitly). See `h264.decode`'s namespace docstring and
   `decode-macroblock-p!`/`decode-inter-16x8-macroblock!`/
   `decode-inter-8x16-macroblock!`/`decode-inter-8x8-macroblock!` for the
   exact scope.

   ALL 3 fixtures below are HAND-AUTHORED using this repo's OWN
   already-bit-exact-tested encode-side primitives — `h264.encode`'s
   `encode-idr-luma-frame` for the reference IDR frame; `h264.expgolomb`'s
   writer + `h264.cavlc/encode-residual-block!` for a hand-built P-slice
   NAL, following `h264.slice/parse-header!`'s exact P-slice syntax order —
   the SAME methodology `p-16x16-mb0-realac.h264`/`p-subpel-diagonal32.h264`
   already use (see `decode_p_slice_test.clj`'s namespace docstring for the
   full rationale: real encoders were not found to reliably emit these
   specific mb_types/sub_mb_type combinations on demand, and even when they
   do, there is no way to CONTROL which one comes out for a targeted
   regression test like fixture 3 below). The independent correctness check
   is the SAME bit-exact-vs-real-ffmpeg discipline this repo's whole decode
   side uses: real `ffmpeg 8.1.1` decodes THESE EXACT bytes to the SAME
   pixels this repo's own `h264.decode` produces — ffmpeg did not see or
   trust anything about how the bytes were constructed, only the bytes
   themselves. Critically, this is NOT a self-consistency tautology even
   though the SAME hand-authored `mvd_l0` values feed both decoders: each
   decoder independently derives its OWN motion-vector PREDICTOR from the
   declared bitstream neighbor state per §8.4.1.3, adds the shared `mvd_l0`,
   motion-compensates, and reconstructs — if this repo's predictor/
   reconstruction logic were spec-non-compliant, its output would differ
   from ffmpeg's independent (correct) reconstruction of the SAME bytes.

   `p-16x8-mb0.h264` — single 16x16 MB, `mb_type`=1 (`P_L0_L0_16x8`), zero
   residual: top partition mvd=(8,0), bottom partition mvd=(-8,8). Since
   there is no left/top/topright/topleft neighbor at all (a single-MB
   picture), the bottom partition's own §8.4.1.3 predictor is derived
   entirely from the TOP partition's OWN already-decided motion vector
   (`neighbor-abc`'s `:self` slot lookup — the top partition sets BOTH the
   TL and TR quadrants of this MB's `:mv-field`, so the bottom partition's
   B-neighbor lookup, which lands on quadrant TL, finds it) — this is the
   most basic exercise of the NEW same-macroblock quadrant-lookup machinery
   `mv-predict-partition`/`neighbor-abc` add.

   `p-8x16-mb0-realac.h264` — single 16x16 MB, `mb_type`=2
   (`P_L0_L0_8x16`), REAL nonzero luma AC residual in the top-left 8x8 luma
   quadrant only (mirrors `p-16x16-mb0-realac.h264`'s own single-nonzero-
   block recipe exactly — one coefficient, level 2, at luma block 0):
   left partition mvd=(4,4), right partition mvd=(-4,-4). The right
   partition's own predictor exercises BOTH the 8x16-specific 'use C
   directly if its ref matches' special case's FALLBACK path (C is
   unavailable here — no topright macroblock exists — so it falls through
   to the general median, per §8.4.1.3.1) AND, within that fallback, the
   same same-macroblock quadrant lookup as fixture 1 (median's own A reads
   the left partition's already-decided TL quadrant).

   `p-8x8-cross-mb-multimb.h264` — 32x16 (2 macroblocks): MB0 = P_8x8
   (`mb_type`=3, `sub_mb_type` P_L0_8x8 x4 — the only supported sub_mb_type)
   with 4 DIFFERENT integer-pel motion vectors, one per 8x8 quadrant
   (TL=(4,0), TR=(-4,0), BL=(0,4), BR=(0,-4)), plus real residual in the TL
   quadrant only; MB1 = P_L0_16x16 with mvd=(0,0). This is the DIRECT
   regression test for the neighbor-derivation fix this increment required:
   MB1's own §8.4.1.3 motion-vector predictor (its 'A' neighbor) must read
   MB0's TR quadrant SPECIFICALLY (`mb-quadrant-mv`, quadrant idx 1) — NOT
   MB0's TL/BL/BR (all of which carry DIFFERENT motion vectors) and NOT
   some flattened 'the whole neighbor macroblock's motion vector' the way
   this repo's P-slice code read neighbors BEFORE this increment (when
   every previously-supported inter mb_type happened to have a single
   uniform motion vector across the whole macroblock, so a flat per-MB
   read was indistinguishable from a quadrant-specific one — see
   `h264.decode/mb-quadrant-mv`'s docstring). If MB1's predictor
   incorrectly read MB0's TL quadrant (4,0) instead of the correct TR
   quadrant (0,0), MB1's final motion vector would be (4,0) instead of
   (0,0), and its reconstructed pixels would NOT match real ffmpeg's
   independent (spec-correct) decode of these same bytes — so the
   bit-exact match asserted below is a genuine, discriminating proof this
   fix is exercised and correct, not an incidental pass. The IDR reference
   frame also carries a REAL 2-D Cb/Cr gradient (not flat) so the 4x4-
   per-quadrant chroma motion-compensated placement
   (`h264.decode/mc-predict-quadrants`) is genuinely exercised too, not
   just luma."
